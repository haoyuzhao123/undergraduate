Computational Biology Project 1 Readme

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
The whole project is written in Python2.7, because some of the packages need Python2.7. And the system that run the whole codes is Ubuntu 16.04 LTS.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
The packages that is used in the Projects are:
numpy
scipy
matplotlib
sklearn
EMAN2 -- a third party package that can read the .mrc file

The first 4 packages can be installed by pip or sudo, the EMAN2 package should unzip the file to the home directory '~/' and then change the path. I don't have the zip file anymore, and the whole package can be downloaded at 'http://blake.bcm.edu/EMAN2/'. There may be other ways to install the EMAN2 package.

The data file 'homework_data/' should be in this folder.

The 'labels/' folder is created by mod_labels_file.py, and do not need to run the code again.

Should first run the code generate_data.py to generate the training data for the first classifier. The command is: python generate_data.py

Then run the generate_second_data.py to generate the training data for the second classifier.

Then run the code first_compute.py, this will generate the 'center_xxx.npy' file and the pictures in 'first_predict_pics/'.

Then run the compute_centers.py. This will generate the pictures in 'compute_centers_pics/' and the final center results in the .star file in 'centers/'

The results of the last 2 steps are just printed on the terminal and I use '> log' and '> log 1' to put them in the log and log1 file in this folder.
